			<p>Welcome to my personal micro portfolio. I am a father to a glorious son and husband to an amazing wife. This is portfolio
				is going to be a representation of my love and interest into web development.</p>

			<p>
				I dabbled with learning to code back in 2010 as a Freelance Graphic Designer. Not really approaching the concept with a structured
				plan I mostly fell about finding my way. I launched a few sites that did the job.
